## So I have a blog again

It's here. I'm going to write something on it.

I might even keep writing things on it regularly. Wouldn't that be nice?

But not too regularly. That might get tedious, and I have to be realistic enough with myself to understand that I would have no chance at all of actually keeping up with that.

However this is all running on GitHub Pages, so I can do online editing from more or less anywhere which is great even if the mobile experience might not be ideal. I'll probably look at building my own theme for it at some point, but until then, it looks like it looks and it does what it does and I'm honestly not even sure how to change the big title in the top of the page right now.
